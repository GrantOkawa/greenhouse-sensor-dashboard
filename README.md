Features
- Real-Time Data Updates: Simulates a live data feed with new sensor readings every 2 seconds.
- Data Filtering: Filter data by temperature, humidity, and air quality using interactive sliders.
- Data Sorting: Sort data by timestamp in ascending or descending order.
- Pagination: Efficiently navigate through large datasets with paginated views.
- Responsive Design: A fluid layout that provides an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Color-Coded Metrics: At-a-glance insights into data with color-coded values for different metric ranges.

Project Structure
The project is organized into a clean and maintainable component-based architecture:
- src/components: Contains all the React components, each responsible for a specific part of the UI.
  - Dashboard.tsx: The main component that manages state and data flow.
  - Header.tsx: Displays the dashboard title and live data status.
  - FilterControls.tsx: Provides controls for filtering and sorting.
  - DataTable.tsx: Renders the data in a table or card view.
  - Pagination.tsx: Handles page navigation.
- src/services: Includes the dataSimulator.ts for generating mock sensor data.
- src/types: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types for data consistency.

Performance Analysis
Performance is a core focus of this application. The following optimizations have been implemented to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience:
- Update Speed: The dashboard updates every 2 seconds. Thanks to efficient memoization, the UI remains fluid even with a high frequency of updates.
- Memory Management: The total number of data points is capped at 5000 to prevent excessive memory consumption and ensure long-term stability.
- Component Memoization: useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo are used extensively to prevent unnecessary re-renders and expensive computations, leading to a highly optimized rendering process. This ensures that UI updates are fast and efficient, even as new data streams in.
