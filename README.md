Key Components
Dashboard.tsx
The main orchestrator component that manages:
- Application state (data, filters, pagination)
- Real-time data subscription
- Performance optimization through memoization
- Event handling coordination

DataTable.tsx
Responsive data presentation component featuring:
- Desktop table view with sortable columns
- Mobile card view for smaller screens
- Color-coded metrics based on optimal ranges
- Memoized rendering for performance

FilterControls.tsx
Interactive control panel providing:
- Range sliders for temperature, humidity, and air quality
- Sort order toggle (newest/oldest first)
- Real-time filter updates
- Responsive grid layout

dataSimulator.ts
Realistic sensor data simulation with:
- Configurable sensor count and update intervals
- Greenhouse-appropriate data ranges
- Clean memory management

ðŸŽ¯ Performance Analysis
Key Metrics

Performance Optimizations
1. Memoization Strategy
- React.memo for component-level memoization
- useMemo for expensive calculations (filtering, sorting)
- useCallback for event handlers

2. Data Management
- Automatic data pruning (5000 record limit)
- Efficient array operations
- Batched state updates

3. Rendering Optimization
- Selective re-renders
- Memoized table rows
- Responsive CSS (no JavaScript media queries)

ðŸ”§Customization Options

Data Ranges
Modify dataSimulator.ts to adjust sensor value ranges:
- temperature: (15 + Math.random() * 25).toFixed(2) // 15-40Â°C
- humidity: (40 + Math.random() * 40).toFixed(2) // 40-80%
- airQuality: (Math.random() * 150).toFixed(2) // 0-150 AQI

Filter Defaults
Update Dashboard.tsx initial filters:
The initial filter settings are defined as follows:
- temperature: { min: 15, max: 35 }
- humidity: { min: 40, max: 80 }
- airQuality: { min: 0, max: 150 }

ðŸŽ¨ Styling & Theming
The application uses Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes:

Color Scheme
- Primary: Green theme (emerald-500, green-400)
- Background: Dark with glassmorphism effects
- Text: White/gray scale for contrast
- Metrics: Color-coded based on optimal ranges

Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px (card view)
- Desktop: â‰¥ 768px (table view)
- Large: â‰¥ 1024px (expanded layout)

Custom CSS classes for responsive design are defined in index.css
